    <h1>Pancode - Types</h1>
    <p>
      As in most programming languages, Pancode deals with different
      types of data. Pancode is dynamically typed and has several
      built-in types of data. The types in Pancode are: numbers,
      strings, lists, functions, boxes, and sentinels. I'll discuss
      each of these in detail below. There is no formal Boolean type
      in Pancode: any value other than zero is truthy (although
      conventionally -1 is used to represent the canonical "true"),
      and zero is falsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a note on comparisons. Many of the comparison operators,
      such as <code>=</code> and <code>‚â§</code>, take two arguments
      and compare them, for equality, inequality, or some ambient
      ordering. Equality never fails, in the sense that it always
      returns either true or false. Two values of different types
      always compare nonequal. Two values of the same type have
      special rules to determine equality, which will be discussed
      below. It's an error to attempt to order two values of different
      types. Two values of the same type may have an ordering defined
      on them, as discussed below.
    </p>
    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Numbers in Pancode are IEEE floating-point values. Equality and
      ordering are defined as specified in the relevant IEEE standard.
      Integers (both positive and negative) can be pushed onto the
      stack using the literal integer itself (with a preceding minus
      sign, when relevant). Note that this is one case in Pancode
      where whitespace matters: <code>- 1</code> is a call to the <code>-</code> subtract
      operator followed by the number one, whereas <code>-1</code> is
      the literal number negative one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IEEE value infinity is written using <code>‚àû</code> (which can be typed using <code>\inf</code>).
      Negative infinity is written using <code>-‚àû</code> (again, there
      must be no space between the two characters). NaN (not a number) is written using <code>üëø</code>
      (<code>\nan</code> or <code>\devil</code>), because that's
      usually how I feel when NaN shows up in my computations.
    </p>
    <h2>Strings</h2>
    <p>
      Strings are effectively arrays of characters. I make no
      guarantee as to the encoding scheme used to store them, so for
      all intents and purposes you should regard them as simply an
      array of code points that is somehow distinct from the
      general-purpose "list" type. Strings can be pushed using <code>"</code> quotation
      marks. Currently, the only supported escape sequences which can
      appear in a Pancode string are <code>\"</code> (for a quotation
      mark), <code>\\</code> (for a literal backslash), and <code>\n</code> (for
      a newline). Note that you are free to include literal newlines
      in your strings, and they'll be preserved. <code>\n</code> is
      merely provided as an, often cleaner, alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two strings compare equal if they have the same characters.
      Strings are compared for ordering using standard dictionary
      order on the code points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strings may be marked as regular expressions using the <code>r</code> command.
      A string marked as a regexp still behaves like a string for most
      intents and purposes, but a few searching commands will treat it
      differently. A regexp will never compare equal to a string. If
      two strings are ordered and one is a regexp, they still follow
      the usual ordering, unless they are the same string, in which
      case the regexp is considered greater.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>
      Lists are finite sequences of Pancode values. Lists can contain
      any Pancode data, including other lists. Lists are generally
      constructed using curly braces <code>{1 2 3}</code> (Note that this is <em>not</em>
      special syntax; this is a call to the <code>{</code> command,
      then three numbers, then a call to the <code>}</code> command),
      and they print to the screen the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two lists are equal if they have the same length and all of
      their values compare equal. Lists are ordered using dictionary
      order, and their values are compared recursively.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are blocks of code that can be run. A function can be
      constructed using square brackets. For instance, <code>[1 +]</code> is
      a function which, when called, runs the <code>1</code> command followed by the <code>+</code> command.
      More succinctly, it is a function which adds one to its sole
      argument. Functions can be called directly using <code>$</code>,
      which pops a function off the stack and calls it. More often,
      functions are called indirectly by various control flow commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an error to try to order two functions. Function equality
      is undefined, in the sense that two functions may or may not
      compare equal, regardless of their definitions, and this result
      may change at any point.
    </p>
    <h2>Boxes</h2>
    <p>
      A box is a simple cell which contains a single Pancode value.
      Boxes can be constructed using <code>‚äÇ</code> and extracted
      using <code>‚äÉ</code>. Boxes are generally used to suppress
      scalar extension on various commands, when we want a command to
      run on a whole list rather than on each element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two boxes compare equal if and only if their contents do. The
      order of two boxes is determined by their order of their
      contents, and it is an error to attempt to order two boxes whose
      contents are not orderable.
    </p>
    <h2 id="sentinels">Sentinels</h2>
    <p>
      Sentinels are special singleton values which are used in various
      places in the Pancode standard library to signal miscellaneous
      things. Two sentinels compare equal if and only if they are the
      same sentinel, and it is an error to try to order sentinels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there are three sentinels defined in Pancode. Each
      sentinel is represented by a single character, and that
      character can also be used as a command to push the
      corresponding sentinel to the stack.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>{</code>, the array start sentinel, is used by the <code>}</code> command
      to allow a natural array construction syntax in Pancode.</li>
      <li><code>‚öê</code>, the white flag sentinel, is passed to a fold
      function to indicate that an empty list was provided. Generally, if given <code>‚öê</code> as
      an argument, a command will return its "neutral" or identity value, so <code>+</code> will
      return 0, <code>√ó</code> will return 1, etc.</li>
      <li><code>Œµ</code>, the null sentinel, is returned by many
      commands in case there's no other reasonable value to return,
      such as when trying to access an out-of-bounds list position, or
      when trying to read from input when there is no input.</li>
    </ul>
