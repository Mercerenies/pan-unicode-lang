    <h1>Pancode - Types</h1>
    <p>
      As in most programming languages, Pancode deals with different
      types of data. Pancode is dynamically typed and has several
      built-in types of data. The types in Pancode are: numbers,
      strings, lists, functions, boxes, and symbols. I'll discuss each
      of these in detail below. There is no formal Boolean type in
      Pancode: any value other than zero is truthy (although
      conventionally -1 is used to represent the canonical "true"),
      and zero is falsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a note on comparisons. Many of the comparison operators,
      such as <code>=</code> and <code>≤</code>, take two arguments
      and compare them, for equality, inequality, or some ambient
      ordering. Equality never fails, in the sense that it always
      returns either true or false. Two values of different types
      always compare nonequal. Two values of the same type have
      special rules to determine equality, which will be discussed
      below. It's an error to attempt to order two values of different
      types. Two values of the same type may have an ordering defined
      on them, as discussed below.
    </p>
    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Numbers in Pancode are IEEE floating-point values. Equality and
      ordering are defined as specified in the relevant IEEE standard.
      Integers (both positive and negative) can be pushed onto the
      stack using the literal integer itself (with a preceding minus
      sign, when relevant). Note that this is one case in Pancode
      where whitespace matters: <code>- 1</code> is a call to the <code>-</code> subtract
      operator followed by the number one, whereas <code>-1</code> is
      the literal number negative one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IEEE value infinity is written using <code>∞</code> (which can be typed using <code>\inf</code>).
      Negative infinity is written using <code>-∞</code> (again, there
      must be no space between the two characters). NaN (not a number) is written using <code>👿</code>
      (<code>\nan</code> or <code>\devil</code>), because that's
      usually how I feel when NaN shows up in my computations.
    </p>
    <h2>Strings</h2>
    <p>
      Strings are effectively arrays of characters. I make no
      guarantee as to the encoding scheme used to store them, so for
      all intents and purposes you should regard them as simply an
      array of code points that is somehow distinct from the
      general-purpose "list" type. Strings can be pushed using <code>"</code> quotation
      marks. Currently, the only supported escape sequences which can
      appear in a Pancode string are <code>\"</code> (for a quotation
      mark), <code>\\</code> (for a literal backslash), and <code>\n</code> (for
      a newline). Note that you are free to include literal newlines
      in your strings, and they'll be preserved. <code>\n</code> is
      merely provided as an, often cleaner, alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two strings compare equal if they have the same characters.
      Strings are compared for ordering using standard dictionary
      order on the code points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strings may be marked as regular expressions using the <code>r</code> command.
      A string marked as a regexp still behaves like a string for most
      intents and purposes, but a few searching commands will treat it
      differently. A regexp will never compare equal to a string. If
      two strings are ordered and one is a regexp, they still follow
      the usual ordering, unless they are the same string, in which
      case the regexp is considered greater.
    </p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>
      Lists are sequences of Pancode values. Lists can contain any
      Pancode data, including other lists. Lists are generally
      constructed using curly braces <code>{1 2 3}</code> (Note that this is <em>not</em>
      special syntax; this is a call to the <code>{</code> command,
      then three numbers, then a call to the <code>}</code> command),
      and they print to the screen the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lists in Pancode can be either eager or lazy. Eager lists are
      inherently finite and are fully stored in memory at all times.
      Lazy lists may store only a finite prefix and a "thunk"
      indicating how to compute the rest of the list. Lazy lists can
      be finite or infinite. Evaluating additional elements of a lazy
      list is called <em>forcing</em> the
      list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two lists are equal if they have the same length and all of
      their values compare equal. Lists are ordered using dictionary
      order, and their values are compared recursively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laziness does not affect the ordering or equality comparisons of
      lists. A lazy list can be equal to an eager list, provided they
      contain the same elements. If two lists are compared for
      equality or ordering and at least one is lazy, the lazy list(s)
      are forced to the point necessary to determine the ordering.
      Note that comparing two infinite lists for equality can cause an
      infinite loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Lazy lists are not yet fully implemented
      in Pancode, so some list functions may not work on them yet. For
      more details, see <a href="https://github.com/Mercerenies/pan-unicode-lang/issues/15">Issue #15</a>.
      This restriction only applies to <em>lazy</em> lists.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are blocks of code that can be run. A function can be
      constructed using square brackets. For instance, <code>[1 +]</code> is
      a function which, when called, runs the <code>1</code> command followed by the <code>+</code> command.
      More succinctly, it is a function which adds one to its sole
      argument. Functions can be called directly using <code>$</code>,
      which pops a function off the stack and calls it. More often,
      functions are called indirectly by various control flow commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an error to try to order two functions. Function equality
      is undefined, in the sense that two functions may or may not
      compare equal, regardless of their definitions, and this result
      may change at any point.
    </p>
    <h2>Slips</h2>
    <p>
      Slips are blocks of code enclosed in corner brackets (<code>｢</code> and <code>｣</code>).
      When a slip is evaluated as literal code, it evaluates its
      inside elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      You generally don't need to deal with slips directly. Slips are
      created as a result of some forms of syntax sugar or macro
      expansions and generally behave behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an error to try to order two slips. Slip equality, like
      function equality, is undefined.
    </p>
    <h2 id="boxes">Boxes</h2>
    <p>
      A box is a simple cell which contains a single Pancode value.
      Boxes can be constructed using <code>⊂</code> and extracted
      using <code>⊃</code>. Boxes are generally used to suppress
      scalar extension on various commands, when we want a command to
      run on a whole list rather than on each element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boxes can also be used to delay evaluation. An expression quoted
      by a single apostrophe <code>'</code> is represented in the
      source code with the box type, and when a box is evaluated, it
      pushes its contents onto the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two boxes compare equal if and only if their contents do. The
      order of two boxes is determined by their order of their
      contents, and it is an error to attempt to order two boxes whose
      contents are not orderable.
    </p>
    <h2 id="symbols">Symbols</h2>
    <p>
      Symbols are the basic structure of Pancode programs. A symbol
      consists of a single character representation and zero or more
      modifiers. Every single-character command which is not
      interpreted as special syntax is itself a symbol command. If a
      literal symbol command appears in the code, it will normally be
      evaluated. Thus, to push an actual symbol to the stack, the
      single quote <code>'</code> special
      command can be used. That is, when it appears literally in the
      code, <code>+</code> is a command which adds numbers, but <code>'+</code> is
      a command which, when evaluated, pushes the symbol <code>+</code> to
      the stack. This is also different from the backtick syntax, as <code>`+</code> is
      equivalent to `<code>[+]</code>, i.e. a function which adds numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two symbols are equal if they have the same character and the
      same modifiers. Numerical modifiers are compared sequentially,
      and so are prime modifiers, but the order of different types of
      modifiers is irrelevant, so <code>+⓪′</code> is equal to <code>+′⓪</code> but <code>+⓪①</code> and <code>+①⓪</code> are
      distinct. When symbols are compared for ordering, they are first
      compared for their characters, then for the numerical modifiers
      in order, then finally for the prime modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain symbols have special designated meanings in Pancode.
      These symbols are sometimes called sentinel values and are used
      to indicate certain behaviors to built-in commands. When using a
      symbol as a sentinel value, one should take care to ensure that
      the symbol has no modifiers attached. For instance, <code>ε</code> is
      the null sentinel (see below), but <code>ε⓪</code> is a distinct
      symbol which happens to have the same text but different
      modifiers. Pancode operations will not treat the latter as a
      sentinel value. Sentinel values, when used as symbol commands,
      always push themselves onto the stack, discarding any modifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there are three sentinels defined in Pancode. Each
      sentinel is represented by a single character.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>{</code>, the array start sentinel, is used by the <code>}</code> command
      to allow a natural array construction syntax in Pancode.</li>
      <li><code>⚐</code>, the white flag sentinel, is passed to a fold
      function to indicate that an empty list was provided. Generally, if given <code>⚐</code> as
      an argument, a command will return its "neutral" or identity value, so <code>+</code> will
      return 0, <code>×</code> will return 1, etc.</li>
      <li><code>ε</code>, the null sentinel, is returned by many
      commands in case there's no other reasonable value to return,
      such as when trying to access an out-of-bounds list position, or
      when trying to read from input when there is no input.</li>
    </ul>
