    <h1>Pancode - Commands - List Operations</h1>
    <p>
      These are various commands which operate on lists. Note that
      some of the <a href="docs_strings.html">string commands</a> also
      work on lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these commands extend their arity in a natural way when
      provided a <a href="docs_concepts.html#numerical-modifier">numerical modifier</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TODO This page is a stub)
    </p>
    <h2>Array End (<code>}</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops values from the stack until the <code>{</code> array start
      sentinel is reached, then places all of the popped values into a
      single list, returning the list.
    </p>
    <h2>Fold (<code>/</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a function. If the list is empty, then this
      command pushes ⚐ to the stack and calls the function once. If
      the list has one element, then that argument is returned. If the
      list has multiple arguments, then the arguments are folded
      together using the provided function, which should take two
      arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're using a built-in command as your reduction function
      (e.g. if you're summing a list with <code>`+/</code>), then the
      case of the empty list involving ⚐ will simply work without any
      intervention. If you have a custom function and you'd like to
      handle the empty list case explicitly, the easiest way to do so
      is with the <a href="docs_miscellaneous.html#white-flag-constructor">White
      Flag Constructor (<code>⚑</code>)</a> command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} `+/ « Result: 10 »</code></pre>
    <h2>Scan (<code>\</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a function. Folds the list, similar to <code>/</code>,
      accumulating each intermediate value along the way. The
      resulting list of accumulated values shall have the same length
      as the original list. Note that, if given a list of length zero
      or one, this function simply returns that list unmodified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} `+\ « Result: {1 3 6 10} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Filter (<code>⌿</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a mask. The mask can either be a function, a
      number, or a list of masks. In the first two cases, the mask is
      repeated into a list of the appropriate length (similar to the
      scalar extension rules). The length of the mask list must equal
      that of the input list. At each position of the input list, the
      corresponding position of the mask list is consulted. If it's a
      number, it's treated as the constant function returning that
      number. If it's a function, it's called with the input list
      element as argument. The absolute value of the result specifies
      how many times to repeat the value in the resulting list.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a numerical modifier, the Filter command will nest as deep
      as the given numerical modifier, so with a modifier of 2, it
      will nest two list layers deep. A numerical modifier of 20 is
      treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">« With a function argument, Filter behaves like the filter function in functional programming languages »
{1 2 3 4 5} [2 | 0 ≡] ⌿ « Result: {2 4} »
« With a list argument, Filter repeats its inputs as specified. »
{1 2 3 4 5} {2 0 3 3 0} ⌿ « Result: {1 1 3 3 3 4 4 4} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Map (<code>¨</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a function. Applies the function to each
      element of the list, producing a resulting list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Takes two numerical modifiers. The first numerical modifier
      specifies the number of lists. If given more than one list, the
      Map command zips the lists (which must have the same length)
      together, applying the function to each corresponding tuple of
      arguments from the respective lists. The second numerical
      modifier specifies the depth of the mapping operation, in a
      similar way to Filter's numerical modifier. If the second
      numerical modifier is 20, it's treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} [1+] ¨ « Result: {2 3 4 5} »
{1 2 3 4} {10 20 30 40} `+ ¨② « Result: {11 22 33 44} »
{{1 2} {3 4}} [1+] ¨①② « Result: {{2 3} {4 5}} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Each (<code>ė</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Behaves exactly like Map (<code>¨</code>), except that Each
      doesn't expect a result from the function it calls and will not
      accumulate a result list. Each takes the same numerical
      modifiers as Map.
    </p>
    <h2>Nested Query (<code>n</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list or string and an index. The index should either be
      a number (in which case it's treated as a singleton list) or a
      list. The index is traversed in order, taking the nth element of
      the list or string at each step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{{1 2} {3 4}} {1 0} n « Result: 3 »</code></pre>
    <h2>Select (<code>⊇</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list or string and an index. The index can either be a
      number or a list. If it's a number, it's treated as a singleton
      list. A new list or string (matching the type of the input) is
      formed, taking the element at each index of the provided index
      list. Invalid indices are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{100 200 300} {0 2 1} ⊇ « Result: {100 300 200} »
"ABCDEF" {3 5 5 3} ⊇ « Result: "DFFD" »</code></pre>
    <h2>Grade Up (<code>⍋</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and sorts it, according to the natural ordering of
      its elements. The sort is guaranteed to be stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a <a href="docs_concepts.html#prime-modifier">prime
      modifier</a>, this command also takes a function, which is used
      for comparison instead of the standard <code><</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Ravel / Flatten (<code>⍪</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Flattens nested lists. By default, this command takes a list and
      flattens one layer of nesting. Given a numerical modifier, this
      command flattens that many layers of nesting. A numerical
      modifier of 20 is treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <h2>Outer Product (<code>⊗</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two lists and a function. Applies the function to every
      possible pair of elements from the two lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{"a" "b"} {"A" "B" "C"} `⋄ ⊗ « Result: {{"aA" "aB" "aC"} {"bA" "bB" "bC"}} »</code></pre>
    <p>
      If given a numerical modifier, this command pops that many lists
      and applies the function to n-tuples.
    </p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{"a" "b"} {"A" "B"} {"x" "y"} [⋄⋄] ⊗③ « Result: {{{"aAx" "aAy"} {"aBx" "aBy"}} {{"bAx" "bAy"} {"bBx" "bBy"}}} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Prepend / Append (<code>∷</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a value and a list and prepends the value to the list.
      With a numerical modifier N, takes N values and prepends them
      all to the list. If given a prime modifier, the values are
      appended to the list instead.
    </p>
    <h2>Member (<code>∈</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and an element. Returns a list of all of the
      indices at which the element is found in the list. With a prime
      modifier, this command instead takes a list and a function and
      returns all of the elements for which the function returns
      truthy.
    </p>
    <h2>Length (<code>#</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the length of its list argument. If given a numerical
      modifier, it will count elements of nested lists (up to the
      given depth) as well. A numerical modifier of 20 is treated as
      infinity.
