    <h1>Pancode - Commands - List Operations</h1>
    <p>
      These are various commands which operate on lists. Note that
      some of the <a href="docs_strings.html">string commands</a> also
      work on lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these commands extend their arity in a natural way when
      provided a <a href="docs_concepts.html#numerical-modifier">numerical modifier</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Array End (<code>}</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops values from the stack until the <code>{</code> array start
      sentinel is reached, then places all of the popped values into a
      single (eager) list, returning the list.
    </p>
    <h2>Lazy List End (<code>}′</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops one value from the stack, which will serve as the "rest"
      parameter and must be either a function or the sentinel value ε.
      Then proceeds to pop values from the stack until the <code>{</code> array
      start sentinel is reached. Returns a lazy list, with the first N
      values already forced and equal to the values popped before the
      sentinel was reached. The "rest" of the lazy list shall be the
      "rest" parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lazy list tries to force a value beyond the available
      ones, the "rest" parameter will be called. It shall take no
      arguments and return two values. The second-from-top of the
      stack is the next value in the list, and the top of the stack is
      the new "rest" parameter. If the "rest" parameter is ever ε, the
      list is considered terminated.
    </p>
    <!-- //// Examples -->
    <h2>Fold (<code>/</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a function. If the list is empty, then this
      command pushes ⚐ to the stack and calls the function once. If
      the list has one element, then that argument is returned. If the
      list has multiple arguments, then the arguments are folded
      together using the provided function, which should take two
      arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're using a built-in command as your reduction function
      (e.g. if you're summing a list with <code>`+/</code>), then the
      case of the empty list involving ⚐ will simply work without any
      intervention. If you have a custom function and you'd like to
      handle the empty list case explicitly, the easiest way to do so
      is with the <a href="docs_miscellaneous.html#white-flag-constructor">White
      Flag Constructor (<code>⚑</code>)</a> command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} `+/ « Result: 10 »</code></pre>
    <h2>Scan (<code>\</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a function. Folds the list, similar to <code>/</code>,
      accumulating each intermediate value along the way. The
      resulting list of accumulated values shall have the same length
      as the original list. Note that, if given a list of length zero
      or one, this function simply returns that list unmodified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} `+\ « Result: {1 3 6 10} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Filter (<code>⌿</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a mask. The mask can either be a function, a
      number, or a list of masks. In the first two cases, the mask is
      repeated into a list of the appropriate length (similar to the
      scalar extension rules). The length of the mask list must equal
      that of the input list. At each position of the input list, the
      corresponding position of the mask list is consulted. If it's a
      number, it's treated as the constant function returning that
      number. If it's a function, it's called with the input list
      element as argument. The absolute value of the result specifies
      how many times to repeat the value in the resulting list.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a numerical modifier, the Filter command will nest as deep
      as the given numerical modifier, so with a modifier of 2, it
      will nest two list layers deep. A numerical modifier of 20 is
      treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">« With a function argument, Filter behaves like the filter function in functional programming languages »
{1 2 3 4 5} [2 | 0 ≡] ⌿ « Result: {2 4} »
« With a list argument, Filter repeats its inputs as specified. »
{1 2 3 4 5} {2 0 3 3 0} ⌿ « Result: {1 1 3 3 3 4 4 4} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Map (<code>¨</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a function. Applies the function to each
      element of the list, producing a resulting list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Takes two numerical modifiers. The first numerical modifier
      specifies the number of lists. If given more than one list, the
      Map command zips the lists (which must have the same length)
      together, applying the function to each corresponding tuple of
      arguments from the respective lists. The second numerical
      modifier specifies the depth of the mapping operation, in a
      similar way to Filter's numerical modifier. If the second
      numerical modifier is 20, it's treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} [1+] ¨ « Result: {2 3 4 5} »
{1 2 3 4} {10 20 30 40} `+ ¨② « Result: {11 22 33 44} »
{{1 2} {3 4}} [1+] ¨①② « Result: {{2 3} {4 5}} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Each (<code>ė</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Behaves exactly like Map (<code>¨</code>), except that Each
      doesn't expect a result from the function it calls and will not
      accumulate a result list. Each takes the same numerical
      modifiers as Map.
    </p>
    <h2>Nested Query (<code>n</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list or string and an index. The index should either be
      a number (in which case it's treated as a singleton list) or a
      list. The index is traversed in order, taking the nth element of
      the list or string at each step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{{1 2} {3 4}} {1 0} n « Result: 3 »</code></pre>
    <h2>Select (<code>⊇</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list or string and an index. The index can either be a
      number or a list. If it's a number, it's treated as a singleton
      list. A new list or string (matching the type of the input) is
      formed, taking the element at each index of the provided index
      list. Invalid indices are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{100 200 300} {0 2 1} ⊇ « Result: {100 300 200} »
"ABCDEF" {3 5 5 3} ⊇ « Result: "DFFD" »</code></pre>
    <h2>Grade Up (<code>⍋</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and sorts it, according to the natural ordering of
      its elements. The sort is guaranteed to be stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a <a href="docs_concepts.html#prime-modifier">prime
      modifier</a>, this command also takes a function, which is used
      for comparison instead of the standard <code><</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Ravel / Flatten (<code>⍪</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Flattens nested lists. By default, this command takes a list and
      flattens one layer of nesting. Given a numerical modifier, this
      command flattens that many layers of nesting. A numerical
      modifier of 20 is treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <h2>Outer Product (<code>⊗</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two lists and a function. Applies the function to every
      possible pair of elements from the two lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{"a" "b"} {"A" "B" "C"} `⋄ ⊗ « Result: {{"aA" "aB" "aC"} {"bA" "bB" "bC"}} »</code></pre>
    <p>
      If given a numerical modifier, this command pops that many lists
      and applies the function to n-tuples.
    </p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{"a" "b"} {"A" "B"} {"x" "y"} [⋄⋄] ⊗③ « Result: {{{"aAx" "aAy"} {"aBx" "aBy"}} {{"bAx" "bAy"} {"bBx" "bBy"}}} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Prepend / Append (<code>∷</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a value and a list and prepends the value to the list.
      With a numerical modifier N, takes N values and prepends them
      all to the list. If given a prime modifier, the values are
      appended to the list instead.
    </p>
    <h2>Member (<code>∈</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and an element. Returns a list of all of the
      indices at which the element is found in the list. With a prime
      modifier, this command instead takes a list and a function and
      returns all of the elements for which the function returns
      truthy.
    </p>
    <h2>Length (<code>#</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the length of its list argument. If given a numerical
      modifier, it will count elements of nested lists (up to the
      given depth) as well. A numerical modifier of 20 is treated as
      infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hangs on infinite lists.
    </p>
    <h2>Bounds Check (<code>⧤</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a number. Returns whether or not that number is
      a valid index into the list. A negative number is considered to
      index from the back of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      This command should be used instead of an explicit length check
      if there's a possibility that the list is infinite. Bounds Check
      will not hang on infinite lists; it will merely force the list
      to enough elements to prove that the input is in bounds.
    </p>
    <h2>Empty (<code>🗋</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns whether or not its list argument is an empty list. If
      given a prime modifier, this command flattens the list
      completely before checking whether or not its empty. The
      following demonstrates the difference between the two variants.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{{} {{}}} 🗋  « Result:  0 (List is not empty) »
{{} {{}}} 🗋′ « Result: -1 (After flattening, list is empty) »</code></pre>
    <h2>List Constructor (<code>ℓ</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      By default, this command takes a single argument and wraps it in
      a list. If given a numerical modifier N, this command pops N
      values off the stack and places them into a list, starting with
      the bottommost value.
    </p>
    <h2>Take (Left) (<code>◁</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a number. Returns the first N
      elements of the list, where N is the absolute value of the
      provided number. If the list is shorter than N, then the
      original list is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always returns an eager list, even if given a lazy list as
      input.
    </p>
    <h2>Take (Right) (<code>▷</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a number. Returns the last N
      elements of the list, where N is the absolute value of the
      provided number. If the list is shorter than N, then the
      original list is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always returns an eager list. Forces the entire input list
      before returning. This function will always hang on infinite
      lists.
    </p>
    <h2>Drop (Left) (<code>⧏</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a number. Returns the list, with
      the first N elements removed, where N is the absolute value of
      the provided number. If the list is shorter than N, then the
      empty list is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returns a lazy list if given a lazy list.
    </p>
    <h2>Drop (Right) (<code>⧐</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a number. Returns the list, with
      the last N elements removed, where N is the absolute value of
      the provided number. If the list is shorter than N, then the
      empty list is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returns a lazy list if given a lazy list.
    </p>
    <h2>Take While (Left) (<code>◂</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a unary function. Calls the
      function for each element of the list, starting at the front,
      until a falsy value is returned. Then the longest prefix of the
      list for which the function returned true is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 2 1} [3 <] ◂ « Result: {1 2} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Take While (Right) (<code>▸</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a unary function. Calls the
      function for each element of the list, starting at the back,
      until a falsy value is returned. Then the longest suffix of the
      list for which the function returned true is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 2 1} [3 <] ▸ « Result: {2 1} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Drop While (Left) (<code>◄</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a unary function. Calls the
      function for each element of the list, starting at the front,
      until a falsy value is returned. Then the rest of the list,
      omitting the prefix for which the function returned true, is
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 2 1} [3 <] ◄ « Result: {3 2 1} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Drop While (Right) (<code>►</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a unary function. Calls the
      function for each element of the list, starting at the back,
      until a falsy value is returned. Then the rest of the list,
      omitting the suffix for which the function returned true, is
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 2 1} [3 <] ► « Result: {1 2 3} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Reverse (<code>ɹ</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a single argument, which must be either a string or a
      list, and returns the argument with its characters or elements,
      respectively, reversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If given a lazy list, forces all elements and returns a
      (reversed) eager list.
    </p>
    <h2>Reshape (<code>⍴</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a list and a shape. The shape should either
      be a list or a number. If the shape is a number, it is treated
      as a single-element list. First, this command flattens the list
      completely. Then a new list is constructed, where each element
      of the shape specifies the length of respective sublists. For
      instance, if the shape is <code>{2 3}</code>, then the resulting
      list will have two elements, and each of those elements will be
      a list containing three elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual elements of the resulting list are drawn from the
      original argument list, starting at the beginning. If there are
      too many elements, the later elements of the argument are
      ignored. If there are too few elements, the elements are
      repeated cyclically as needed, starting back at the beginning.
      It is an error to pass an empty list as the first argument to
      this command.
    </p>
    <p>
      If given a numerical modifier, that modifier specifies the depth
      by which to flatten the list before reshaping, using the same
      rules as the Ravel command. Note that the default numerical
      modifier to Reshape is 20, which is treated as infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 2 3 4} {2 2} ⍴ « Result: {{1 2} {3 4}} »
{1 2 3} {2 2} ⍴ « Result: {{1 2} {3 1}} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Lazy List Check (🦥)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes one argument. Returns true if the argument is a lazy list.
      Returns false on non-lazy lists and on arguments which are not
      lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a fully-forced lazy list is still lazy. To convert a
      lazy list to an eager one, use the Eager-ify (🐇) command.
    </p>
    <h2>Eager-ify (🐇)</h2>
    <p>
      Converts a list into an eager list, forcing all elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Lazy-ify (🐢)</h2>
    <p>
      Converts a list into a lazy list. If the list was an eager list,
      then it will be converted into a fully-forced lazy list. If the
      list was a lazy list, it is returned unmodified.
    </p>
    <h2>First (<code>⁰</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and returns its first element.
    </p>
