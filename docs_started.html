    <h1>Pancode - Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Pancode tutorial! If you're reading this, you're
      probably at least a little interested in esoteric programming
      languages. If you're looking for a language to use for your next
      big production project, then you should probably keep looking.
      If you're a project manager and your developers sent you to this
      page, then you're either being pranked or they're <em>very</em>
      confused. Pancode is a language made for fun. It's probably not
      even that great for golfing, at least if you're counting bytes
      rather than characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pancode is an esoteric stack-based programming language designed
      to heavily utilize many of the Unicode glyphs. If you're editing
      your code in the <a href="index.html">online interpreter</a>,
      then there are several <a href="docs_input.html">keyboard shortcuts</a> for
      inputting the many characters used in this language, which I'll
      mention during this tutorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, let's start with everybody's favorite: the obligatory
      Hello World program.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">"Hello, world!" .</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can copy this line of code over to the <a href="index.html">interpreter</a> and
      hit "Run" (or press SHIFT+ENTER in the code box). You should see
      the output "Hello, world!" at the bottom of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As already mentioned, Pancode is a stack-based language. That
      means that all commands run on a global value stack. In
      particular, the above snippet has two such commands. The first
      is a literal string <code>"Hello, world!"</code> which pushes
      itself onto the stack when run, and the second <code>.</code> is
      a built-in which pops and prints the top value of the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, that's pretty basic. Let's talk numbers. Any good language
      needs a way to work with numbers. In Pancode, any literal
      integer, possibly preceded by a minus sign, is a literal number
      command which pushes itself when executed.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">1 2 3 . . .</code></pre>
    <p>
      The above snippet prints 3, 2, and 1 on separate lines. Note
      that the values are printed in reverse, since <code>.</code> pops
      the top value of the stack each time, and the top value is the
      most recently pushed value. Also, you can simply remove the three <code>.</code> from
      the end of the snippet and run it.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">1 2 3</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now you won't see any output, but you'll instead see the three
      values in the "Final Stack" section below the code. This is
      useful for debugging purposes, as the final stack will print out
      even if your program crashes with an error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pancode has all of the usual arithmetic functions. <code>+</code> pops
      two numbers and pushes their sum, and <code>-</code> pops two
      numbers and pushes their difference. In the spirit of showing
      Unicode some love, Pancode uses <code>×</code> for
      multiplication and <code>÷</code> for division. You can input <code>×</code> by
      typing <code>\times</code>, and you can input <code>÷</code> by typing <code>\div</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a side note, if you're comfortable with APL, you can also in
      many cases use shortcuts derived from APL. Generally, if Pancode
      uses a character that appears on an APL keyboard, you can type
      it in the Pancode editor by preceding the APL key with a dot.
      So, for instance, <code>×</code> appears on the <code>-</code> key
      on an APL keyboard, so you can type it with <code>.-</code>.
      Likewise, you can get <code>÷</code> with <code>.=</code>. If
      you're not familiar with APL, you'll probably be more
      comfortable with the LaTeX-style backslash shortcuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's do some arithmetic. Let's calculate <code>(3 + 4) × (2 - 3)</code>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">3 4 + 2 3 - ×</code></pre>
    <p>
      Your final stack should be <code>-7</code>. Note that
      stack-based arithmetic starts to resemble reverse Polish
      notation. In particular, we don't need any parentheses anymore
      to disambiguate operator order.
