    <h1>Pancode - Commands - IO</h1>
    <p>
      The following commands deal with input/output. Note that, in the
      online interactive console, input is provided through an
      explicit "Input" textbox and output is printed below the
      program.
    </p>
    <h2>Pretty Print (<code>.</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops one value from the stack and pretty-prints it to output.
    </p>
    <h2>Read Integer (<code>,</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads a valid integer from input and pushes it onto the stack.
      Returns ε if input is empty or there is no valid integer to
      consume.
    </p>
    <h2>Read Character (<code>📜</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads a single character from input and pushes it onto the stack
      as a single-character string. Returns ε if input is empty.
    </p>
    <h2>Read Line (<code>📖</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads from input until it encounters a newline or the end of
      input, pushing the resulting string. Returns ε if input is
      empty. Note that the newline is included in the resulting string
      and can be removed with Chomp (🍴)
    </p>
    <h2>Read All (<code>📚</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads all remaining input and pushes it onto the stack as a
      string. If there's no input, returns ε.
    </p>
    <h2>Panic (<code>😱</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops one value from the stack and halts the program with an
      error. The error will include, in some form, the value which was
      popped.
