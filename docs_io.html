    <h1>Pancode - Commands - IO</h1>
    <p>
      The following commands deal with input/output. Note that, in the
      online interactive console, input is provided through an
      explicit "Input" textbox and output is printed below the
      program.
    </p>
    <h2>Pretty Print (<code>.</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops one value from the stack and pretty-prints it to output.
    </p>
    <h2>Read Integer (<code>,</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads a valid integer from input and pushes it onto the stack.
      Returns ε if input is empty or there is no valid integer to
      consume.
    </p>
    <h2>Read Character (<code>📜</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads a single character from input and pushes it onto the stack
      as a single-character string. Returns ε if input is empty.
    </p>
    <h2>Read Line (<code>📖</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads from input until it encounters a newline or the end of
      input, pushing the resulting string. Returns ε if input is
      empty. Note that the newline is included in the resulting string
      and can be removed with Chomp (🍴)
    </p>
    <h2>Read All (<code>📚</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Reads all remaining input and pushes it onto the stack as a
      string. If there's no input, returns ε.
    </p>
    <h2>Print Whole Stack (<code>🙋</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Print every element of the stack, from bottom to top. Does not
      modify the stack in any way. The exact format of the text
      printed by this command is subject to change at any time, as it
      is mainly intended for debugging use.
    </p>
    <h2>Panic (<code>😱</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops one value from the stack and halts the program with an
      error. The error will include, in some form, the value which was
      popped.
    </p>
    <h2>Handle Error (<code>🙏</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two functions. Invokes the first function. If it returns
      normally, then control proceeds as normal. If it throws an
      error, then the second function will be called with the original
      call stack and the error itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that, in the case of error, the call stack is rolled back
      to its state at the time the 🙏 command was invoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">1 [ 2 "error" 😱 ] [ % . ] 🙏 « Prints 1, not 2 »</code></pre>
