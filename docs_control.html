    <h1>Pancode - Commands - Control Flow</h1>
    <p>
      The following commands perform routine control-flow techniques,
      such as conditionals and primitive loops. Note that commands
      which operate on lists, such as folds or for-each commands, are
      listed on the <a href="docs_lists.html">List Operations</a> page.
    </p>
    <h2>If (<code>i</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes three arguments. The first argument can be any value, but
      the latter two must be functions. If the first argument is
      truthy, then the second argument is called. Otherwise, the third
      argument is called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">1 [ "true" ] [ "false" ] i « Result: "true" »
0 [ "true" ] [ "false" ] i « Result: "false" »</code></pre>
    <h2>While (<code>w</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments, both of which must be functions. First,
      this command calls the first function (the condition). If the
      first function returns truthy, then this command pops the truthy
      value and then calls the second function and then repeats the
      process. If the first function returns falsy at any point, this
      command stops running, pops the falsy value, and returns
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">« The following prints the numbers from 0 to 9 »
0 [ : 10 < ] [ : . 1 + ] w</code></pre>
    <h2>Abbreviated While (<code>W</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to While, but the condition and body are combined into
      one function. Specifically, Abbreviated While takes one
      argument, which must be a function. That function is called. If
      it returns a truthy value, then that value is popped and the
      process repeats. If the function returns a falsy value, then
      that value is popped and this command returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">« The following prints the numbers from 0 to 9 »
0 [ : . 1 + : 10 < ] W</code></pre>
    <h2>Repeat (<code>⍳</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a number and a function. The function is
      called N times, where N is the provided number. The function
      will be called with arguments from 0 to N-1, inclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">« The following prints the numbers from 0 to 9 »
10 `. ⍳</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note that if you wish to construct a list indexed by the first N
      natural numbers, it is simple to do so using Repeat by wrapping
      it in curly braces. For example
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{10ī⍳} « Result: {0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9} »</code></pre>
    <h2>Accumulate (<code>⍸</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes three arguments: an initial value, a number, and a
      function. Similar to Repeat, the function will be called N
      times, where N is the provided number. When the function is
      called, it will be given two values: the accumulator and the
      index. The index acts the same as in Repeat (i.e. it will be the
      numbers from 0 to N-1, inclusive). The accumulator starts off as
      the initial value and will be set at each iteration to the
      return value of the last iteration. An eager list of all of the
      accumulators (including the initial value) is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the argument N is equal to ∞, then the returned list shall be
      lazy and infinite in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">« The first 7 factorials »
1 6 [1+×] ⍸
« Lazy list of all factorials »
1 ∞ [1+×] ⍸</code></pre>
    <h2>Call (<code>$</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops a single value, which must be a function, and calls it once.
    </p>
    <h2>Eval (<code>📝</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops a single value off the stack and evaluates it, as though it
      had appeared literally in the source code. Note that this is
      different than calling a function (<code>$</code>). If given a
      function as argument, Eval (<code>📝</code>) will push the
      function back onto the stack, as function literals evaluate to
      themselves. If given a symbol or slip, the command or sequence
      of commands present will be evaluated.
    </p>
    <h2>Normalize Boolean (<code>🜀</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Pops one argument. Pushes zero if the argument is zero, or one
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <h2>Logical Conjunction (<code>⩚</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns true if both are truthy, or
      false otherwise. Subject to <a href="docs_concepts.html#binary-extension">binary
      extension</a>. Returns -1 if given ⚐ or a numerical modifier of
      zero.
    </p>
    <h2>Logical Disjunction (<code>⩛</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns true if either is truthy, or
      false otherwise. Subject to <a href="docs_concepts.html#binary-extension">binary
      extension</a>. Returns 0 if given ⚐ or a numerical modifier of
      zero.
    </p>
    <h2>Logical Exclusive Or (<code>△</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments, normalizes both to Boolean, and returns the
      exclusive-or of the two. Subject to <a href="docs_concepts.html#binary-extension">binary
      extension</a>. Returns 0 if given ⚐ or a numerical modifier of
      zero.
    </p>
    <h2>Logical Negate (<code>⌙</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes one argument. Returns -1 if the argument is falsy, or 0
      otherwise.
