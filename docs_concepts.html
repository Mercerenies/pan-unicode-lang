    <h1>Pancode - Concepts</h1>
    <p>
      This page acts as something of a glossary for several concepts
      that recur throughout the Pancode language. It's not really
      intended to be read linearly, as the relevant sections are
      linked from the documentation when they're mentioned.
    </p>
    <h2 id="binary-extension">Binary Extension</h2>
    <p>
      Many commands which are designed to be binary may be extended
      with a <a href="#numerical-modifier">numerical modifier</a>. In
      particular, if given a numerical modifier of N, these commands
      will take N arguments and fold the argument list using the
      binary command. For instance, <code>+</code> is a command which
      adds two numbers, while <code>+⑧</code> is a command which adds
      eight numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a command with binary extension does not specify its
      associativity, you may assume it associates to the left, so <code>a b c +③</code> will
      do <code>(a + b) + c</code> not <code>a + (b + c)</code>. This
      is irrelevant for associative commands but can come into play
      for others such as <code>-</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a command subject to binary extension is given the numerical
      modifier of 0 or 1, special behavior often triggers. This
      behavior is specific to the given command but follows a general
      theme. If given numerical modifier zero, a command will
      generally produce its identity or neutral value, e.g. zero for
      addition or one for multiplication. If there's no sensible
      identity, a numerical modifier of zero results in an error. If
      given a numerical modifier one, "negative" commands like <code>-</code> and
      <code>÷</code> will return the inverse of their sole argument
      (respectively, the additive and multiplicative inverse).
      "Positive" commands like <code>+</code> and <code>×</code> will
      return their argument untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      If both <a href="#scalar-extension">scalar extension</a> and
      binary extension apply to a command, binary extension applies
      first, and scalar extension applies to the resulting binary
      command.
    </p>
    <h2 id="numerical-modifier">Numerical Modifier</h2>
    <p>
      Many commands take optional numerical modifier. These are
      distinct from standard stack-based arguments in that they are
      provided as constants to the command itself. Numerical modifiers
      can be any value from 0 to 20 and are given by placing the
      "Circled Digit" characters (⓪ to ⑳) after the command itself.
      For instance, to supply a numerical argument of 4 to <code>+</code>,
      you would write <code>+④</code>.
      These circled characters can be typed using <code>\(0)</code>, <code>\(1)</code>,
      etc. Numerical modifiers are always optional and will take
      reasonable defaults if not provided. If too many numerical
      modifiers are provided, the excess ones will be ignored
      silently.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scalar-extension">Scalar Extension</h2>
    <p>
      Some commands provide scalar extension behavior. Effectively,
      this means that if given a list argument, the command will
      automatically apply to each element of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simplest case is scalar extension applied to a unary
      command, such as the negation command <code>_</code>. By default, <code>_</code> takes
      a single number argument and returns its additive inverse.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">3 _ « Produces -3 »</code></pre>
    <p>
      However, if applied to a list, it will happily negate every
      element of that list, recursively applying to nested lists as
      well.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">{1 {2} {{3} 4}} _ « Produces {-1 {-2} {{-3} -4}} »</code></pre>
    <p>
      For binary commands, scalar extension is slightly more complex.
      If given two non-lists, the command simply runs normally on the
      two arguments. If given one list and one non-list, it runs on
      each element of the list, keeping the other argument constant.
      If given two lists, the lists must be the same length, and it
      zips the lists together, applying the command to each
      corresponding pair. Like in the unary case, this extension will
      happily recurse arbitrarily deeply into nested lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some examples, using the binary command <code>+</code>,
      which applies the scalar extension rules.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">1 2 + « Produces 3 »
{1 2 3} 10 + « Produces {11 12 13} »
{1 2 3} {10 20 30} + « Produces {11 22 33} »
{{1 2} {3 4}} {10 20} + « Produces {{11 12} {23 24}} »</code></pre>
    <p>
      For commands where both scalar extension and either <a href="#binary-extension">binary</a> or
      <a href="#transitive-extension">transitive extension</a> would apply, the latter takes precedent
      first, converting the command into a binary one, and then scalar
      extension acts on the resulting binary command.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transitive-extension">Transitive Extension</h2>
    <p>
      Transitive extension is similar to <a href="#binary-extension">binary extension</a>,
      in that it takes a traditionally binary command and uses its
      <a href="#numerical-modifier">numerical modifier</a> to extend
      it to an n-ary command. Transitive extension mainly applies to
      comparison-oriented commands, such as <code><</code> and <code>></code>.
      Transitive extension applies the binary command to each pair of
      adjacent arguments and then returns true if all of the results
      are true, or false otherwise. For instance,
    </p>
    <pre><code class="pancode-snippet">1 2 3 4 <④</code></pre>
    <p>
      This code will check whether <code>1 < 2</code>, then check
      whether <code>2 < 3</code>, then whether <code>3 < 4</code>, and
      return true since all of those are true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise specified, a numerical modifier of zero to a
      command which supports transitive extension will simply return
      true, while a numerical modifier of one will produce an error.
      In a case where both <a href="#scalar-extension">scalar extension</a> and
      transitive extension apply, transitive extension applies first,
      and scalar extension applies to the resulting binary command.
