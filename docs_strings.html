    <h1>Pancode - Commands - String Operations</h1>
    <p>
      These are various commands which operate on strings. Some of
      these will also work on lists, where it makes sense to do so.
      These cases are explicitly mentioned when they occur.
    </p>
    <h2>Concatenate (<code>‚ãÑ</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two strings or lists and returns a new string or list
      which is the concatenation of the two. The two must have the
      same type. Subject to <a href="docs_concepts.html#binary-extension">binary extension</a>.
      If given a numerical modifier of zero, returns the empty string.
    </p>
    <h2>Chr / Ord (<code>üí¨</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Expects either a number, string, or list as an argument, and
      performs an appropriate operation based on the type of its
      argument. If given a number, returns a string consisting of the
      character whose code point is that value. If given a list,
      returns a string whose characters have code points equal to each
      value in the list. If given a string, returns the list of code
      points.
    </p>
    <h2>Chomp (<code>üç¥</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a string argument and removes the final character if that
      character is a newline. If not, the string is returned
      unmodified. Subject to <a href="docs_concepts.html#scalar-extension">scalar extension</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Mark as Regexp (<code>r</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a string and returns a new string identical to the first
      but marked as a regular expression. This string behaves
      identically to the original for most purposes, but if used in a
      command which involves searching or replacing, it will be
      treated as a regular expression rather than a literal string.
    </p>
    <h2>Split String (<code>¬∂</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments: a string and a delimiter. The delimiter can
      be either a string or a regular expression. The string is split
      based on the delimiter, and a list of strings is returned.
    </p>
    <h2>Join String (<code>‚Åã</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a list and a delimiter. Each element of the list is
      prettified, then they are joined together, using the delimiter
      (which must be a string) in between each pair of adjacent
      elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Prettify (<code>p</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a single argument and converts it to a string in a natural
      way. If the argument is already a (non-regexp) string, it will
      not be changed.
