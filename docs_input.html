    <h1>Pancode - Input Method</h1>
    <p>
      You may have noticed Pancode uses a decent bit of Unicode, in
      particular the language uses several characters you probably
      don't have on your keyboard right now. The interpreter provided
      on this site has several special input combinations to make it
      easier for you to input these various characters. Many of these
      combinations are taken from LaTeX (<code>\times</code> converts
      to <code>×</code>), <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/tools/emacs-mode.html"
      target="_new">Agda Mode</a> (<code>\Gi</code> converts to <code>⍳</code>), and
      <a href="https://github.com/lokedhs/gnu-apl-mode" target="_new">GNU APL Mode</a> (<code>.[</code> converts
      to <code>←</code>), as well as whatever mnemonics make sense for
      Pancode in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      What follows is a comprehensive list of these special input
      combinations. Simply type any of the phrases on the right-hand
      side to get the character on the left-hand side. This table is
      generated dynamically from the Javascript interpreter, so it's
      guaranteed to be up to date. You can also mouse-over Unicode
      characters in the documentation to see how to input them.
