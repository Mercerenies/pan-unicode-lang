# Pancode

The pan-Unicode programming language! Pancode is a stack-based
esoteric programming language written by Mercerenies. You can check
out the
[documentation](https://mercerenies.github.io/pan-unicode-lang/docs.html)
or dive straight in to the [online
interpreter](https://mercerenies.github.io/pan-unicode-lang/index.html).
Note that the language is a work-in-progress, so expect some changes,
and in particular more thorough documentation is coming soon.
