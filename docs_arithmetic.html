    <h1>Pancode - Commands - Arithmetic</h1>
    <p>
      The following commands perform basic mathematical and bitwise
      operations. Many of these commands are subject
      to <a href="docs_concepts.html#scalar-extension">scalar
      extension</a> and use
      a <a href="docs_concepts.html#numerical-modifier">numerical
      modifier</a> to
      enable <a href="docs_concepts.html#binary-extension">binary
      extension</a>. Note that the <a href="docs_trigonometry.html">trigonometric commands</a>
      have their own page.
    </p>
    <h2>Add (<code>+</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Adds two numbers. Subject to scalar and binary extension. If
      given a numerical modifier of 0, this command pushes <code>0</code>.
      If given ⚐ as its sole argument, this command pushes <code>0</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Subtract (<code>-</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Subtracts two numbers. Subject to scalar and binary extension.
      With a numerical modifier of 1, this command returns the
      negative of its sole argument.
    </p>
    <h2>Multiply (<code>×</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Multiplies two numbers. Subject to scalar and binary extension.
      With a numerical modifier of 0, pushes <code>1</code>. If given
      ⚐ as its sole argument, this command pushes <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Divide (<code>÷</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Divides two numbers. Subject to scalar and binary extension.
      With a numerical modifier of 1, this command returns the
      reciprocal of its argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that since Pancode uses IEEE floats, division by zero is
      not an error and will simply return either infinity, negative
      infinity, or NaN, as per the IEEE specification.
    </p>
    <h2>Power (<code>*</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Raises its first argument to the power of its second. Subject to
      scalar and binary extension (binary extension associates to the
      right). If given a numerical modifier of 0, this command returns <code>1</code>.
      If given ⚐ as its sole argument, this command pushes <code>1</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Exponent (<code>ê</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a single argument and returns the mathematical constant <code>e</code> raised
      to that power. Subject to scalar extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Natural Logarithm (<code>🌳</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a single argument and returns the natural logarithm of
      that argument. Subject to scalar extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Logarithm (<code>🌳′</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns the logarithm of the first in
      the base of the second. Subject to scalar and binary extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Square Root (<code>√</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes a single argument and returns its square root. Subject to
      scalar extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Nth Root (<code>√′</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns the nth root of the first, where
      n is the second argument. Subject to scalar and binary extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Remainder (<code>|</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns the first argument modulo the
      second. Subject to scalar extension but <em>not</em> binary
      extension. The sign of the result shall match that of the
      divisor.
    </p>
    <h2>LCM (<code>⩑</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns their least common multiple.
      Subject to scalar and binary extension. With a numerical
      modifier of 0 or a ⚐ argument, returns 1.
    </p>
    <h2>GCD (<code>⩒</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and returns their greatest common divisor.
      Subject to scalar and binary extension. With a numerical
      modifier of 0 or a ⚐ argument, returns 0.
    </p>
    <h2>Negate (<code>_</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the negative of its argument. Subject to scalar
      extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Reciprocal (<code>⅟</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the reciprocal of its argument. Subject to scalar
      extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Ceiling (<code>⌉</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the least integer greater than or equal to its argument.
      Subject to scalar extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Floor (<code>⌋</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the greatest integer less than or equal to its argument.
      Subject to scalar extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Absolute Value (<code>A</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the absolute value of its argument. Subject to scalar
      extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Signum (<code>a</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Returns the sign of its argument. Subject to scalar extension.
    </p>
    <h2>Bitwise Conjunction (<code>∧</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and performs the bitwise-and operation on
      them. The two numbers are treated as being in two's complement
      form. The result is undefined if either number is not an
      integer. Subject to scalar and binary extension. Returns <code>-1</code> with
      a numerical argument of 0 or a ⚐ argument.
    </p>
    <h2>Bitwise Disjunction (<code>∨</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and performs the bitwise-or operation on
      them. The two numbers are treated as being in two's complement
      form. The result is undefined if either number is not an
      integer. Subject to scalar and binary extension. Returns <code>0</code> with
      a numerical argument of 0 or a ⚐ argument.
    </p>
    <h2>Bitwise Exclusive Or (<code>⊕</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes two arguments and performs the bitwise-xor operation on
      them. The two numbers are treated as being in two's complement
      form. The result is undefined if either number is not an
      integer. Subject to scalar and binary extension. Returns <code>0</code> with
      a numerical argument of 0 or a ⚐ argument.
    </p>
    <h2>Bitwise Negate (<code>¬</code>)</h2>
    <p>
      Takes one argument and takes its bitwise negation. Subject to
      scalar extension.
